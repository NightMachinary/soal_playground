** phase I
*** benchmark a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means) on
**** scalability
***** feature size (10k needed)

**** time

**** memory

**** GPU/TPU support

**** How much can it saturate the computing device?

**** correctness

**** flexibility of the implementation
***** hyperparameters

*** Find other clustering algorithms and repeat.
