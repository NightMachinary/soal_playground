* project todos
** phase I
*** [[./datasets.org][Find good datasets.]]

*** benchmark a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means) on
**** scalability
***** feature size (10k needed)

**** time

**** memory

**** GPU/TPU support

**** How much can it saturate the computing device?

**** correctness
***** internal clustering metrics?

***** completeness score

***** homogeneity score

**** flexibility of the implementation
***** hyperparameters

*** Find other clustering algorithms and repeat.
